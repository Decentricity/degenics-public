# Degenics in a nutshell

## A privacy first, anonymous genetic sequencing and analysis platform 

Degenics aims at providing anonymous and privacy-guaranteed genetic testing for a wide range of uses, from personal wellness to disease detection. 

Degenics is a decentralized platform that brings institutional or independent PCR operators together with health specialist in order to deliver genome sequencing and its analysis, and uses cryptography to make sure those results are private to consumers. 

# WHY?

## To provide an alternative to centralized personal genetic testing services, an alternative where privacy is enforced at infrastructure level, where users control their data from sending to monetization

## To empower labs everywhere possible by adding to their revenue streams and optimizing their PCR equipment yield

## To provide consumers with a stigma-free, private and anonymous health service, be it for lifestyle or healthcare motives

# Opportunities

## A Sizable Market

As per the report published by Allied Market Research, the global genetic testing market generated $12.68 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach **$21.26 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 10.1% from 2020 to 2027**.

## An Answers to Several Problems

### **PROBLEM ** : PERSONAL GENOMICS COMPANIES OWN, MONETIZE , OR LEAK USER DATA AND PERSONAL ID.

It is no secret that certain conditions and illnesses come together with social stigma. Requiring physical presence and named documents may prevent their efficient detection and/or prevention. 

Beyond the social aspect, personal genomics company are in possession of their user's ID, personal data and DNA analysis data. Those data, that should belong exclusively to the service's users. [These companies already sell users' genes to pharmacogenetics research with arguable consent.](https://time.com/5349896/23andme-glaxo-smith-kline/)

Personal genomic companies [are already being hacked ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-05/hack-of-dna-website-exposes-data-from-92-million-user-accounts)in certain cases.

**ANSWER**: Degenics uses a blockchain based network together with additional cryptographic measures to ensure that users can remain anonymous , and the sole owners of their data. Reuse and monetization are possible, and entirely up to the users.

### PROBLEM : CUSTOMERS CAN'T NORMALLY CHECK THE EFFICIENCY AN ACCURACY OF THE SEQUANCING RESULTS, UNLESS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LABS AT HOME

While it might be possible to download raw genome sequencing result from DNA analysis services, users generally do not have the means nor the knowledge to perform their own analysis. Second opinions require another end-to-end sampling, sending and analysis process, which causes time, money and further data exposure. 

**ANSWER**: Degenics lets users download their initial DNA sequencing files and resubmit it to health specialists on a need-to basis. As a control system users are also able to select more than one lab to generate those initial results, which contribute to mitigate inconsistencies and isolate bad potential bad actors.



### PROBLEM: PCR DEVICES ARE EXPENSIVE AND NOT ALWAYS READILY AVAILABLE, WHICH DRIVES UP CONSUMER PRICES AND TESTING SERVICE YEILD

Accurate PCR devices represent a real investment for heath related institutions. DIY kits do exist, but their precision level isn't enough to carry a comprehensive range of tests. As a result, waiting time and service prices are kept up. 

**ANSWER** : Degenics can onboard independent laboratories, universities, clinics, hospital and DYI genomics enthusiasts to create a high availability marketplace, where DIY owners see a raise in income, and users can enjoy more affordable prices. 

## A Wide Rage of Extended Uses

### Self Data Monetization

1. Users have the option to sell their non PID genetic data to parties that requires this data for research
2. A system to protect the data and monitor access to the data is required.
3. Purchasers of genetic data will be required to make a payment in fiat or DGNX token in order to access this data.
4. Fiat payment that is received will be used to purchase the DGNX token from crypto markets
5. This DGNX tokens will be re-distributed or burned according to the decision of the DAO
