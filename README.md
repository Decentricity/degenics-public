Decentralized Genetics Project

### This file provides the concept document for the Degenics project.

Organizational repo for the project is at github.com/Degenics

### Elevator Pitch

Degenics: The Decentralized Genetics Initiative
We are building a decentralized platform for your personal genetics.
Our concept allows synergy between labs of all scales while guaranteeing user anonymity and sovereignty at every step of the genomic data science workflowâ€”
from sample collection, data storage, to report generation.

### Vision

We aim to democratize direct-to-consumer genomics with a privacy-preserving, anonymous-first platform running on a fully decentralized, autonomous infrastructure.

### MVP Vision

Degenics 1.0 (private deployment March 2021) will provide anonymous, decentralised sample collection, payment, data storage, and report distribution. 
TL;DR: a VPN for your DNA.

### Who we are

Degenics is a group of IT consultants, blockchain developers, and biologists who are passionate about privacy, decentralized technologies, and genomic data science.
